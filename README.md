# mathbench

[![Build Status]][travis-ci]

**NOTE:** This is a fork of [`mathbench-rs`](https://github.com/bitshifter/mathbench-rs),
used for benchmarking [`bevy_math_extensions`][bevy_math_extensions].
This is not actively maintained and may be out of date.

`mathbench` is a suite of unit tests and benchmarks comparing the output and
performance of a number of different Rust linear algebra libraries for common
game and graphics development tasks.

`mathbench` is written by the author of [`glam`][glam] and has been used to
compare the performance of `glam` with other similar 3D math libraries targeting
games and graphics development, including:

* [`bevy_math_extensions`][bevy_math_extensions]
* [`cgmath`][cgmath]
* [`euclid`][euclid]
* [`nalgebra`][nalgebra]
* [`pathfinder_geometry`][pathfinder_geometry]
* [`static-math`][static-math]
* [`ultraviolet`][ultraviolet]
* [`vek`][vek]

## The benchmarks

All benchmarks are performed using [Criterion.rs]. Benchmarks are logically into
the following categories:

* return self - attempts to measure overhead of benchmarking each type.
* single operations - measure the performance of single common operations on
  types, e.g. a matrix inverse, vector normalization or multiplying two
  matrices.
* throughput operations - measure the performance of common operations on
  batches of data. These measure operations that would commonly be processing
  batches of input, for example transforming a number of vectors with the same
  matrix.
* workload operations - these attempt to recreate common workloads found in game
  development to try and demonstrate performance on real world tasks.

Despite best attempts, take the results of micro benchmarks with a pinch of
salt.

### Operation benchmarks

* `matrix benches` - performs common matrix operations such as transpose,
  inverse, determinant and multiply.
* `rotation 3d benches` - perform common 3D rotation operations.
* `transform 2d & 3d benches` - bench special purpose 2D and 3D transform types.
  These can be compared to 3x3 and 4x4 matrix benches to some extent.
* `transformations benches` - performs affine transformations on vectors - uses
  the best available type for the job, either matrix or transform types
  depending on the library.
* `vector benches` - perform common vector operations.

### Workload benchmarks

* `euler bench` - performs an Euler integration on arrays of 2D and 3D vectors

The benchmarks are currently focused on `f32` types as that is all `glam`
currently supports.

## Crate differences

Different libraries have different features and different ways of achieving the
same goal. For the purpose of trying to get a performance comparison sometimes
`mathbench` compares similar functionality, but sometimes it's not exactly the
same. Below is a list of differences between libraries that are notable for
performance comparisons.

### Matrices versus transforms

The `euclid` library does not support generic square matrix types like the other
libraries tested. Rather it has 2D and 3D transform types which can transform 2D
and 3D vector and point types. Each library has different types for supporting
transforms but `euclid` is unique amongst the libraries tested in that is
doesn't have generic square matrix types.

The `Transform2D` is stored as a 3x2 row major matrix that can be used to
transform 2D vectors and points.

Similarly `Transform3D` is used for transforming 3D vectors and points. This
is represented as a 4x4 matrix so it is more directly comparable to the other
libraries however it doesn't support some operations like transpose.

There is no equivalent to a 2x2 matrix type in `euclid`.

### Matrix inverse

Note that `cgmath` and `nalgebra` matrix inverse methods return an `Option`
whereas `glam` and `euclid` do not. If a non-invertible matrix is inverted by
`glam` or `euclid` the result will be invalid (it will contain NaNs).

### Quaternions versus rotors

Most libraries provide quaternions for performing rotations except for
`ultraviolet` which provides rotors.

## Wide benchmarks

All benchmarks are gated as either "wide" or "scalar". This division allows us
to more fairly compare these different styles of libraries.

"scalar" benchmarks operate on standard scalar `f32` values, doing calculations
on one piece of data at a time (or in the case of a "horizontal" SIMD library
like `glam`, one `Vec3`/`Vec4` at a time).

"wide" benchmarks operate in a "vertical" AoSoA (Array-of-Struct-of-Arrays)
fashion, which is a programming model that allows the potential to more fully
use the advantages of SIMD operations. However, it has the cost of making
algorithm design harder, as scalar algorithms cannot be directly used by "wide"
architectures. Because of this difference in algorithms, we also can't really
*directly* compare the performance of "scalar" vs "wide" types because they
don't *quite* do the same thing (wide types operate on multiple pieces of data
at the same time).

The "wide" benchmarks still include `glam`, a scalar-only library, as a
comparison. Even though the comparison is somewhat apples-to-oranges, in each of
these cases, when running "wide" benchmark variants, `glam` is configured to do
the exact same *amount* of final work, producing the same outputs that the
"wide" versions would. The purpose is to give an idea of the possible throughput
benefits of "wide" types compared to writing the same algorithms with a scalar
type, at the cost of extra care being needed to write the algorithm.

To learn more about AoSoA architecture, see [this blog
post](https://www.rustsim.org/blog/2020/03/23/simd-aosoa-in-nalgebra/) by the
author of `nalgebra` which goes more in depth to how AoSoA works and its
possible benefits. Also take a look at the ["Examples"
section](https://github.com/termhn/ultraviolet#examples) of `ultraviolet`'s
README, which contains a discussion of how to port scalar algorithms to wide
ones, with the examples of the Euler integration and ray-sphere intersection
benchmarks from `mathbench`.

Note that the `nalgebra_f32x4` and `nalgebra_f32x8` benchmarks require a Rust

Additionally the `f32x8` benchmarks will require the `AVX2` instruction set, to
enable that you will need to build with `RUSTFLAGS='-C target-feature=+avx2`.

## Build settings

The default `profile.bench` settings are used, these are documented in the
[cargo reference].

Some math libraries are optimized to use specific instruction sets and may
benefit building with settings different to the defaults. Typically a game team
will need to decided on a minimum specification that they will target. Deciding
on a minimum specifiction dictates the potential audience size for a project.
This is an important decision for any game and it will be different for every
project. `mathbench` doesn't want to make assumptions about what build settings
any particular project may want to use which is why default settings are used.

I would encourage users who to use build settigs different to the defaults to
run the benchmarks themselves and consider publishing their results.

## Benchmark results

The following is a table of benchmarks produced by `mathbench` comparing `glam`
performance to `cgmath`, `nalgebra`, `euclid`, `vek`, `pathfinder_geometry`,
`static-math` and `ultraviolet` on `f32` data.

These benchmarks were performed on an [Intel i7-4710HQ] CPU on Linux. They were
compiled with the `1.56.1 (59eed8a2a 2021-11-01)` Rust compiler. Lower
(better) numbers are highlighted within a 2.5% range of the minimum for each
row.

The versions of the libraries tested were:

* `cgmath` - `0.18.0`
* `euclid` - `0.22.6`
* `glam` - `0.20.1`
* `nalgebra` - `0.29.0`
* `pathfinder_geometry` - `0.5.1`
* `static-math` - `0.2.3`
* `ultraviolet` - `0.8.1`
* `vek` - `0.15.3` (`repr_c` types)

### Wide benchmarks

These benchmarks were performed on an [Intel i7-4710HQ] CPU on Linux. They were
compiled with the `1.59.0-nightly (207c80f10 2021-11-30)` Rust compiler. Lower
(better) numbers are highlighted within a 2.5% range of the minimum for each
row.

The versions of the libraries tested were:

* `glam` - `0.20.1`
* `nalgebra` - `0.29.0`
* `ultraviolet` - `0.8.1`

Run with the command:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS='-C target-feature=+avx2' cargo +nightly bench --features wide wide
```

## Running the benchmarks

The benchmarks use the criterion crate which works on stable Rust, they can be
run with:

```sh
cargo bench
```

For the best results close other applications on the machine you are using to
benchmark!

When running "wide" benchmarks, be sure you compile with with the appropriate
`target-feature`s enabled, e.g. `+avx2`, for best results.

There is a script in `scripts/summary.py` to summarize the results in a nice
fashion. It requires Python 3 and the `prettytable` Python module, then can
be run to generate an ASCII output.

## Default and optional features

All libraries except for `glam` are optional for running benchmarks. The default
features include `cgmath`, `ultraviolet` and `nalgebra`. These can be disabled
with:

```sh
cargo bench --no-default-features
```

To selectively enable a specific default feature again use:

```sh
cargo bench --no-default-features --features nalgebra
```

Note that you can filter which benchmarks to run at runtime by using
Criterion's filtering feature. For example, to only run scalar benchmarks
and not wide ones, use:

```sh
cargo bench "scalar"
```

You can also get more granular. For example to only run wide matrix2 benchmarks,
use:

```sh
cargo bench --features wide "wide matrix2"
```

or to only run the scalar "vec3 length" benchmark for `glam`, use:

```sh
cargo bench "scalar vec3 length/glam"
```

### Crate features

There are a few extra features in addition to the direct features referring to
each benchmarked library.

* `ultraviolet_f32x4`, `ultraviolet_f32x8`, `nalgebra_f32x4`,
  `nalgebra_f32x8` - these each enable benchmarking specific wide types from
  each of `ultraviolet` or `nalgebra`.
* `ultraviolet_wide`, `nalgebra_wide` - these enable benchmarking all wide
  types from `ultraviolet` or `nalgebra` respectively.
* `wide` - enables all "wide" type benchmarks
* `all` - enables all supported libraries, including wide and scalar ones.
* `unstable` - see next section

#### `unstable` feature

The `unstable` feature requires a nightly compiler, and it allows us to tell
rustc not to inline certain functions within hot benchmark loops. This is used
in the ray-sphere intersection benchmark in order to simulate situations where
the autovectorizer would not be able to properly vectorize your code.

## Running the tests

The tests can be run using:

```sh
cargo test
```

## Publishing results

When publishing benchmark results it is important to document the details of how
the benchmarks were run, including:

* The version of `mathbench` used
* The versions of all libraries benched
* The Rust version
* The build settings used, especially when they differ from the defaults
* The specification of the hardware that was used
* The output of `scripts/summary.py`
* The full Criterion output from `target/criterion`

## Adding a new library

There are different steps involved for adding a unit tests and benchmarks for a
new library.

Benchmarks require an implementation of the `mathbench::RandomVec` trait for the
types you want to benchmark. If the type implements the `rand` crate
`distribution::Distribution` trait for `Standard` then you can simply use the
`impl_random_vec!` macro in `src/lib.rs`. Otherwise you can provide a function
that generates a new random value of your type pass that to `impl_random_vec!`.

To add the new libary type to a benchmark, add another `bench_function` call to
the `Criterion` `BenchmarkGroup`.

Increment the patch version number of `mathbench` in the `Cargo.toml`.

Update `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Build times

`mathbench` also includes a tool for comparing full build times in
`tools/buildbench`. Incremental build times are not measured as it would be non
trivial to create a meaningful test across different math crates.

The `buildbench` tool uses the `-Z timings` feature of the nightly build of
`cargo`, thus you need a nightly build to run it.

`buildbench` generates a `Cargo.toml` and empty `src/lib.rs` in a temporary
directory for each library, recording some build time information which is
included in the summary table below. The temporary directory is created every
time the tool is run so this is a full build from a clean state.

Each library is only built once so you may wish to run `buildbench` multiple
times to ensure results are consistent.

By default crates are built using the `release` profile with default features
enabled. There are options for building the `dev` profile or without default
features, see `buildbench --help` for more information.

The columns outputted include the total build time, the self build time which is
the time it took to build the crate on it's own excluding dependencies, and the
number of units which is the number of dependencies (this will be 2 at minimum).

When comparing build times keep in mind that each library has different feature
sets and that naturally larger libraries will take longer to build. For many
crates tested the dependencies take longer than the math crate. Also keep in
mind if you are already building one of the dependencies in your project you
won't pay the build cost twice (unless it's a different version).
